OK so on my laptop, the window is 31 cm wide, and that's 16.0f for the engine

So a 1.0f in Unity is 1.9375cm on screen.

And a target moves at 5.0f/s if it's fast, or 3.0f/s if it's "slow"
Ergo, speeds are 5.8125 cm/s and 9.6875 cm/s
Which is pretty damn fast, but the targets are a bit over 12mm in diameter in homo mode

So that's quite different from before.

The repositioning distance is 4.5f, or 8.71875cm

But on a 24" display, you've got to multiply everything by 24/15 = 1.6

So 1.0f becomes 3.1 cm
16.0f becomes 49.6 cm
9.0f becomes 27.9 cm
3.0f is 9.3 cm
5.0f is 15.5 cm
4.5f is 13.95 cm

And the targets are a good 19.2 mm in diameter
